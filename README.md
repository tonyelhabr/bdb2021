# how impactful are they?

+ epa break down... broken down by how long into the play?
+ basic t-test to show statistical significant (accounting for smaller sample size)?

# how often do they happen?

+ do they occur more frequently on a certain down? 
+ a certain part of the field?
+ late in the game?
+ in a close game?
+ when do the intersections occur (in terms of seconds into a play)?

+ do certain teams run them more often?
+ which receivers are most often involved?

# how do defenses guard them?

+ are certain teams "targeted"?
+

# do certain defensive schemes work better against them?


# extensions
